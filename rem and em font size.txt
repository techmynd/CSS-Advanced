rem is realtive unit and its root based


body {font-size:16px;}
h1 {font-size:1.5 rem;}
p {font-size:1rem;}

1.5rem = 1.5 * 16px = 24px;

rem is root font size based unit for children.
root font size is body font size.

===================================


em is x * parent font size
em is not root based.

If a div has 16px font size
- div h1 can heva 1.5em font size > 1.5 * 16 = 24px
- div p can have 1em font size > 16px

====================================

for font > reference is the parent
for length (width, height, padding, margins) > reference is element itself

if a div has 2em padding - it means its 2 * its font size
If its font-size is 150px and body has 16px font than its font size = 24px
and padding will be 24 * 2 = 48px

REM vs EM - Root vs Parent - Relative/Reference units. At the end everything converts to px.
